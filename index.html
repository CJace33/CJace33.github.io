				<p>Gemini is a mobile game made for my third year group project, along with Caitlin White, 
				Jamie Chandler and Jordan Marks. All of the nebula backgrounds used on this website were created by Caitlin. 
				This was my first experience making a large game as my previous group projects only lasted one semester, this one spanned two.</p>
				<p>This game taught me many skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Expanded my Unity abilities</li>
					<li>Working on long-term projects</li>
					<li>Creating and building mobile games</li>
					<li>Expanded my Unity UI skills</li>
					<li>Saving and loading JSON files (they are used here to create and store the information for the levels)</li>
					<li>Switching between scenes in unity</li>
					<li>Debugging on mobile</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a name = "Mythos">Mythos App:</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.paranoid-miniatures.com/home.html">Mythos</a>
				 is a niche wargame successfully <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/254891487/mythos/description">kickstarted</a> by paranoid miniatures in 2017 </p>
				<p>Stuart Phillips is a member of The Dragons Initiative and one of the designers of Mythos. I offered to create an app for
				Mythos that would allow players to build their parties, keep a track of the game state and otherwise replace the physical cards that
				the game normally requires. Though this was a part of a university module, I was very happy to create an app that would further
				expand my skills and also to work on a more utilitarian app, instead of a game.</p>
				<p>This has given me the following skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Storing and loading large amounts of information</li>
					<li>Creating a primarily UI based app and heavily taking into account UX (as the app had to compete with the cards the game normally uses)</li>
					<li>Working with professionals outside of a learning environment</li>
					<li>Constantly iterating based off user and designer feedback</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Behavior tree elements</li>
					<li>3D programming in unity</li>
					<li>Unity3D navmesh</li>

				<p>Building this website has taught me how to use HTML5 and CSS. It was a fun experience and I quite like the outcome.</p>

				<h2>Random Book Generator</h2>
				<p>This random generator came about because wanted to practice using .net, and because I had seen a Reddit post that showed a fairly complicated table for randomly generating books for D&D. Though not one of my more complicated projects, it is noteworthy because I was so enthusiastic about it, and it took me less than an hour to complete. When I have the time, I would like to create a similar app that uses the random name tables in "Xanathat's Guide to Everything" to generate names based on those tables, ideally taking from external files so they can be edited and added to.</p>
