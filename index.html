				<p>Gemini is a mobile game made for my third year group project, along with Caitlin White, 
				Jamie Chandler and Jordan Marks. All of the nebula backgrounds used on this website were created by Caitlin. 
				This was my first experience making a large game, as my previous group projects only lasted one semester, this one spanned two.</p>
				<p>This game taught me many skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Expanded my Unity abilities</li>
					<li>Working on long-term projects</li>
					<li>Creating and building mobile games</li>
					<li>Expanded my Unity UI skills</li>
					<li>Saving and loading JSON files (they are used here to create and store the information for the levels)</li>
					<li>Switching between scenes in unity</li>
					<li>Debugging on mobile</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a name = "proj2">Mythos:</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.paranoid-miniatures.com/home.html">Mythos</a>
				 is a niche wargame successfully <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/254891487/mythos/description">kickstarted</a> by paranoid miniatures in 2017 </p>
				<p>Stuart Phillips is a member of The Dragons Initiative and one of the designers of Mythos. I offered to create an app for
				Mythos that would allow players to build their parties, keep a track of the game state and otherwise replace the physical cards that
				the game normally requires. Though this was a part of a university module, I was very happy to create an app that would further
				expand my skills and also to work on a more utilitarian app, instead of a game.</p>
				<p>This has given me the following skills:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Storing and loading large amounts of information</li>
					<li>Creating a primarily UI based app and heavily taking into account UX (as the app had to compete with the cards the game normally uses)</li>
					<li>Working with professionals outside of a learning environment</li>
					<li>Constantly iterating based off user and designer feedback</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a name = "proj3">Final Project:</h2>
				<p>My final project for university is a guard AI for a 3D environment, using behavior trees to make intelligent decisions and </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Behavior tree elements</li>
					<li>3D programming in unity</li>
					<li>Unity3D navmesh</li>
					<li></li>
				</ul>

				<h2><a name = "proj5">Website:</h2>
				<p>Building this website has taught me how to use HTML5 and CSS. It was a fun experience and I quite like the outcome.</p>
