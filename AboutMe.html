					<p><h2>The Dragon's Initiative</h2></p>
					
					<p>The Dragon's initiative is a club that I co-founded to provide a place to play
					D&D. It currently hosts six games of D&D over the course of four weeks, two of which
					I DM and another two of which I play in and is based is Gainsborough community library. </p>
					
					<p>DI was founded off the back of a previous club named M.I.A, which had provided a similar
					space for wargames and tabletop RPG's, however it eventually became unsustainable. Leigh Woolard and I
					co-founded DI using our experience as committee members at M.I.A to avoid the same 
					mistakes the old club was plagued by.</P>
					
					<p>I enjoy the responsibility of running the club, arranging for new games to take place, as well as open days
					and my own responsibilities as a GM.</p>
